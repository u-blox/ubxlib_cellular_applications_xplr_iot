#* UBXLIB MUTEX DEBUGGING   Uncomment this line to enable the

#*                          print out mutex information if a mutex
#*                          lock isn't given for a period of time
#*                          NOTE: Must also enable ubxlib debug
#*                          logging too. See above.
#*                          NOTE: Must re-compile ubxlib too as
#*                          this #define will enable that code.
